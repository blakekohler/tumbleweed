# Wecome to Tumbleweed
Tumbleweed is a platform dedicated to sharing information about developer experiences at companies around the world. 

We're hoping to share the following: 
-   Onboarding experiences 
-   Salary history
-   Equipment and new equipment request process
-   Developer growth process 
-   Future onboarding ideas


We hope to be able to have build a checklist for onboarding to help guide groups through doing onboarding well. 


Started work on styling the front page and looking into resources. Found a group of resources here:
